# Smart-Monitoring-System-For-Automobiles
Through this project, our goal is to implement a continuous monitoring system based on the concept of connected
car technology. This system will assist the transport authority in monitoring vehicle registration, insurance,
fitness, license, current location, and emissions through a black box unit integrated into the vehicles. The aim is
to provide a closed-loop solution for vehicle owners and the transportation authority, ensuring that their vehicle
documents are kept up to date and encouraging vehicle owners to adhere to transport rules and regulations for
their vehicles.
